# Vaadin Charts Web Component

## Overview
Vaadin Charts is a feature-rich interactive charting library for Web Components developers. It provides a Chart Web Component. The Chart can visualize one- and two-dimensional numeric data in many available chart types. The charts allow flexible configuration of all the chart elements as well as the visual style. The library includes a built-in visual theme, which you can extend further. 
Vaadin Charts is based on Highcharts JS, a charting library written in JavaScript.

The data displayed in a chart can be one- or two dimensional tabular data, or scatter data with free X and Y values. Data displayed in range charts has minimum and maximum values instead of singular values.

In the following basic example, we demonstrate how to display one-dimensional data in a pie chart and customize its title.

    <html>
        <head lang="en">
            <!-- Load platform support -->
            <script src="../../webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
            <!-- Load the component using an HTML Import -->
            <link rel="import" href="../v-chart.html">
        </head>
        <body>
            <!-- Declare the chart element by its tag. -->
            <v-chart id="pieChart" type="pie">
                <title>Browser market shares at a specific website, March 2015</title>
    
                <!-- Declare the series element by its tag. -->
                <v-series name="Browser share">
                    <data>
                        ["Chrome",   49.19],
                        ["IE",       18.06],
                        ["Firefox", 16.96],
                        ["Safari",    10.4],
                        ["Opera",     1.65],
                        ["Others",   3.74]
                    </data>
                </v-series>
            </v-chart>
        </body>
    </html>
